        This is a 2.5D platformer inclined to SCI-FI plot given in a Matrix-Dune
        mixed setting. It illustrates possible future with 200-300 years ahead.
        It is aimed to immerse you into mysterious rather post-apocalyptical
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        You experience catastrophic results after alien invasion but mysterious
        forces going along to help you in your hard journey. Hardcore abilities
        which humanity managed to learn and possess - excelled to the max by the
        main character Eve - all of this makes this game somewhat unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eve does not remember almost anything from the past and awakens in a
        strange sterile lab. She is surrounded by unknown Dark Entities who
        nevertheless start introducing Eve to the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eve is dying and the help from outside is limited, though she knows now
        how she can survive and struggle further against invaders. Going her way
        to the destination point she gathers piece by piece information about
        her past and present.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end she might learn something about her future and understand the
        real balance of what is real and what is not in this already alien world
        to her.
